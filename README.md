# AlchemyClub Dao Club

Alchemy Dao Club allows you to manage investment clubs, and to spread access to participate in investment funds to anyone, decentralized, agile, and without bureaucracy.Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.

For years I have wanted to participate in fund initiatives to invest in projects (startups and others), but the bureaucracy, the high requirements, and many other problems make it very difficult. And it is something that not only I experience, but also many other people who have a little money and want to support projects in the medium/long term.

The exact size of the private investment fund market is difficult to determine, as there is no single, comprehensive source of data. However, it is estimated that this market has experienced significant growth in recent decades. According to Bain & Company's Global Private Equity Report 2021, assets under management in the private equity industry reached a record of approximately US$4.6 trillion in 2020. In addition to traditional private equity, there are also other types of private investment funds, such as hedge funds, venture capital funds, and private debt funds. Each of these segments has distinct characteristics and investment approaches.

Therefore, through DAO (decentralized organizations) we can create structures so that anyone can invest, through investment clubs (by affinity of ideas, professional relationship, etc.) through Blockchain from anywhere in the world and with fewer requirements. That is why Alchemy Club  was born.

## üí°Introduction

## What you can currently do in this version is:

- Create investment clubs: Just define a name and the club will be associated with the account of the user who creates it (owner).
- Join or leave clubs: Anyone with an aeternity blockchain account can join the available investment clubs, as well as leave one, with just a couple of clicks.
- Contribute to the club: Any member of a club can contribute to the common fund (pool), depositing AE coins that can be used in proposals.
- Create and Vote on Proposals: Any member who has contributed funds to the club pool can create proposals, giving a description, amount (not to exceed the pool amount), and recipient, with a view to investing in any business/person in a project. Also, all members can approve or reject the proposal (only one vote per member is allowed on each proposal).
- Run Proposals: A proposal owner can execute a proposal (if approval is greater than rejection), which will cause the proposal amount to be sent to the specified recipient. The owner can also close a proposal, in case of not continuing with it, either as a cancellation, publication error or to avoid sending funds.
- Timing voting:  After  creation of proposal there is only about 5 min time is given to the  mmeber to  vote.


## Restrictions
The club smart contract has some restrictions, similar to real hedge funds:

- Up to 99 members per club (in many jurisdictions, such as the USA and Chile, this is the maximum limit of club members for certain purposes and types of clubs).
- Only members can participate in club instances.
- Only members who contribute funds to a club have the right to create proposals.
- Only proposal creators can execute them.


## üí• Challenges we ran into
I faced issue with the accout abstraction  bundler and gas manager.
I faced issue with the persistance of Particle network gets solved  by the mentor: https://github.com/Vikash-8090-Yadav/AlchemyCLub/pull/1
